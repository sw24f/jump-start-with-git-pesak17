# Personal Notes
+ After attending office hours with professor Yan, I learned that GitHub is a cloud where we can send new versions of work to other people
+ A repo shows all the changes that have been saved
+ Use git clone to create a copy of a repository
+ Reflection: GitHub is extremely convenient for people to work with each other without having to send the file in an email
